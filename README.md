# Fullstack-Engineer-Coding-Challenge
The purpose of this repository would be to demonstrate knowledge and best practices necessary for full stack development. 

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
* Node Package Manager
    * npm
    * yarn
    * PHP
    * Typescript
    * Python

```

### Installing

A step by step series of how to get a development env running

1. Backend Folder selection
   - Node
     1. npm / yarn install
     2. npm / yarn start
   - Go
     1. go run main.go
   - PHP

    - static
      - simply open file in browser
     

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
