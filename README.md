# Fullstack-Engineer-Coding-Challenge
The purpose of this repository would be to demonstrate knowledge and best practices necessary for full stack development. 

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
* Node Package Manager
    * Node
    * npm
    * yarn
    * Typescript
```
 **NOTE** Please determine backend project prior to using select a front-end folder
```

### Installing

A step by step series of how to get a development env running

1. Backend Folder selection
   - Node
     1. npm / yarn install
     2. npm / yarn start
   - Typescript
     1. npm / yarn install 
     2. npm / yarn webpack
     3. npm / yarn start
2. Front-end Folder selection
    - Angular
      1. npm / yarn install
      2. npm / yarn start
    - react
      1. npm / yarn install
      2. npm / yarn start
    - static
      - simply open file in browser
     

In effort to highlight technical proficiency and interests. The intention of multiple approaches would be in hopes to stand-out among other candidates. Though, not included I also have experience developing REST API in GO, PHP, and Python

That being said lets get to it.

## Running the tests

I have designed and developed test cases, though not extensive. I wanted to include them to highlight that I am aware of unit test endpoints, methods (or functions depending who you ask)

* yarn test

A report will the be generated and saved in a folder named "mochawesome-report", entering the folder open the index.html file.

## Deployment

Though, not requested I also wanted to include containerized capabilities for each backend soluton.

## Built With

* docker-compose up -d nodejs

## Versioning tool
* git
